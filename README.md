This is a simple example project using imgui with SDL 3. At the time of writing, SDL 3 is a preview release, so if it has officially released and this isn't compiling, something may have changed. I'll try to remember to go back and fix this if that happens.

A fair amount was copied from the example in imgui's examples, but it's more useful for me to have an actual project set up that uses it with cmake that I can copy and base new projects on, and I'm making it public so other people can use it as well.
